**Language:** Kotlin  
**Gradle Version:** ~6.5 (now deprecated)

## 📝 Description

This is one of several early projects I built while learning Android development with Kotlin in 2021. These apps were created as part of my self-teaching and experimentation phase, helping me get comfortable with Android Studio, UI layout tools, and Kotlin syntax.

While not polished, these projects reflect an important part of my learning journey.

## 📂 Why It's on GitHub Now

These projects are being archived here for **posterity** and **version control**, not as current portfolio pieces. Reasons for uploading include:

- 🧠 Tracking my programming growth and habits  
- 📚 Restructuring my local project folders and documentation  
- 🔧 Possible future revisits to rework/refactor ideas with improved knowledge  

This also gives me a chance to maintain a historical archive as I build more advanced versions in future, or remake them using current best practices.

## ⚠️ Notes

- These apps use an outdated Gradle version and may not run on modern Android Studio without modification.
- Source code is basic and may include deprecated patterns or rough UI logic.
- This is **learning-era code** — not production-ready!

## ✅ Included Projects

- **Basic Calculator** – A simple arithmetic calculator with a UI.
- **Login Screen** – A UI prototype of a login form with dummy validation.
- **MUUDS App (Early Attempt)** – A draft app based on a concept from my publishing project.
- **Temperature Converter** – Converts Celsius/Fahrenheit in both directions.
- **Weather Changer** – Small UI demo mimicking a weather toggle interface.

## 🔮 Future Plans

These apps may be revisited and rebuilt in modern form — for example, with:

- Jetpack Compose
- MVVM architecture
- Updated Gradle and SDKs
- Better UI/UX principles

## 💡 Final Note

This repo is a **learning archive**, not a showcase. It’s part of a broader process to tidy up my development history and set the stage for more advanced projects moving forward.
